#  Math Supernova Lab

**Math Supernova Lab** is a high-performance mathematics engine built for **real-time computation**, **interactive visualization**, and **modular scalability**.  
It demonstrates strong command over **TypeScript**, **mathematical algorithms**, and **modern frontend engineering** using **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Bun**.

This project was developed to explore how complex mathematical functions can be computed and rendered efficiently in the browser — combining logic, performance, and visual clarity.

## Overview

Math Supernova Lab transforms abstract mathematical concepts into interactive, visual, and computational experiences.  
It bridges theoretical mathematics with practical computation — enabling users to visualize and experiment with equations dynamically.

**Core Goals**
- Build a modular and extendable computation engine.
- Achieve real-time rendering with minimal latency.
- Maintain clean, scalable, and type-safe architecture.

## How It Works

### 1. Computation Engine
The **core engine** processes mathematical expressions entered by the user.  
It parses and evaluates expressions dynamically using a modular computation layer.

- **Input Parsing:** Reads algebraic and trigonometric expressions.  
- **Computation Layer:** Executes mathematical functions efficiently with TypeScript.  
- **Error Handling:** Detects syntax or domain errors and displays friendly feedback.

### 2. Visualization Pipeline
The **visualization module** converts computation results into smooth, animated graphs.

- Built using **Canvas** or **SVG rendering** for real-time visual updates.  
- Animations highlight function changes, rotations, or transformations.  
- Designed to minimize redraw lag and frame drops.

**Pipeline Flow**
User Input → Parser → Computation Engine → Visualization Generator → Graph Renderer

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading:** Loads modules only when needed.  
- **Memoization:** Caches frequently computed results for faster updates.  
- **TypeScript Safety:** Prevents runtime errors through static type checking.  
- **Vite + Bun:** Ensures blazing-fast builds and instant reloads.

##  Key Features

 **Modular Architecture** – Each mathematical operation is its own isolated module.  
 **Real-Time Visualization** – Live feedback for all equations and transformations.  
 **Error Resilience** – Graceful handling of invalid inputs or computation errors.  
 **Responsive UI** – Tailwind CSS ensures smooth experience across devices.  
 **Optimized Performance** – Built to handle both simple and complex math operations efficiently.

##  Example: Function Plotting

**Input**
f(x) = sin(x) + 0.5 * cos(2x)

**Process**
1. The computation engine discretizes the input into data points.  
2. Each `(x, f(x))` pair is evaluated dynamically.  
3. The visualization layer renders a smooth, continuous curve.  
4. Graph updates occur instantly when the function changes.

**Output**
A dynamic, real-time trigonometric wave visualization.
